# RNASeq_Pipeline_nextflow
An automated RNASeq Pipeline, from raw reads to counts matrix by using open source bioinformatic tools such as FastQC, Trimmomatic, Hisat2-align and featureCounts with Nextflow.

System Requirements:
```
RAM: 16 GB (depends on the system)
CPU: 16
Docker (To be installed)
```

In this RNASeq Pipeline, using docker containers for all the tools.

To running this RNASeq pipeline,
   - To keep all the input files in data/reads directory.
   - keep all the reference files such as fasta file and hisat2-index files, gtf file in /data directory.
   - keep the adapter file also in /data directory.

In this RNASeq Pipeline, we can be able to run both hg38 (GRCh38) and hg19 (GRCh37) version. Based on your requirement,
we have to download the respective reference fasta and gtf and their hisat2-index files (should be generated by using hisat2-build tool from reference fasta) and located in ./data directory.
*download link for hg38:
```

```
*For hg19:
```

https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/grch37/current/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.gtf.gz
```
* - these links are updated frequently. verify once before using it.

To mention the read type paired-end or single-end like, in the rnaseq.nf file
```
params.read_type = "SE"
(or)
params.read_type = "PE"
```
else, mention the read type info in the command line itself.
```
nextflow run rnaseq.nf -profile docker --read_type SE
```

To mention the input files in the rnaseq.nf file like
```
params.paired_end_files = "${params.data_dir}/reads/sample_*_{R1,R2}.f*.gz" for paired-end
params.single_end_files = "${params.data_dir}/reads/sample_*_R1.f*.gz" for single-end
```

To run the pipeline for single-end input files:
```
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -e PROJECT_DIR=$PWD\
 -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD nextflow/nextflow:24.10.5 nextflow run rnaseq.nf -profile docker --read_type SE
```
for Paired-end input files:
```
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -e PROJECT_DIR=$PWD\
 -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD nextflow/nextflow:24.10.5 nextflow run rnaseq.nf -profile docker --read_type PE
```
